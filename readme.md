A tool to login IOE Pulchowk's lan server using account details.

Directions:
Edit the acc.ini file to add your account details.

Required Dependencies:
Selenium
ChromeDriver (or equivalent but need to modify inside the main .py)

Current version:
Have to run script manually, all else handled. Poor error handling since can't detect if wrong username and password.

Future goals:
Put in startup and make fully automatic (needs to detect hardware change in ethernet or similar modem and execute script)
